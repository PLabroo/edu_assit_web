        <h4>Graduate Record Examination</h4>
        <p>The Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) is a standardized test that is an admissions requirement for many
          graduate schools in the United States and Canada.The GRE is owned and administered by Educational Testing
          Service (ETS).The test was established in 1936 by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of
          Teaching.According to ETS, the GRE aims to measure verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, analytical
          writing, and critical thinking skills that have been acquired over a long period of learning. The content of
          the GRE consists of certain specific algebra, geometry, arithmetic, and vocabulary sections. The GRE General
          Test is offered as a computer-based exam administered at Prometric testing centers. In the graduate school
          admissions process, the level of emphasis that is placed upon GRE scores varies widely between schools and
          departments within schools. The importance of a GRE score can range from being a mere admission formality to
          an important selection factor.</p>
