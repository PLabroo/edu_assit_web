  <!-- Intro -->
  <div class="intro">
    <div class="show-on-scroll intro-head">
      <h5>What is Indian Civil Service?</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="show-on-scroll intro-body">
      <p> The Civil Services refer to the career bureaucrats who are the permanent executive branch of the Republic of India. The civil service system is the backbone of the administrative machinery of the country.In India's parliamentary democracy,
        the ultimate responsibility for running the administration rests with the people's elected representatives—cabinet ministers. But a handful of ministers cannot be expected to deal personally with the manifold problems of modern administration.
        Thus the ministers lay down the policy and it is for the civil servants, who serve at the pleasure of the President of India, to carry it out. However, Article 311 of the constitution protects them from politically motivated or vindictive
        action.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="show-on-scroll intro-body">
      <p>Civil servants are employees of the Government of India or of the states, but not all employees of the Government are civil servants. As of 2010, there were 6.4 million government employees in India but fewer than 50,000 civil servants to
        administer them. Civil servants in a personal capacity are paid from the Civil List. Senior civil servants may be called to account by Parliament. The civil service system in India is rank-based and does not follow the tenets of the
        position-based civil services. The Government of India has also approved the formation of two new cadres of civil servants: the Indian Skill Development Service (2015) and the Indian Enterprise Development Service (2016). </p>

        <h4>Exam Pattern</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h6>Preliminary</h6>
            <p>The pattern of the Preliminary examination up to 2010 was based on the recommendations of the Kothari Commission (1979). It included two examinations, one on general studies worth 150 marks, and the second on one of 23 optional
              subjects worth 300 marks. Until 2011, when it was revamped, the preliminary pattern was sustained with only minor changes once every ten to fifteen years.</p>
            <p>From 2011 onwards, the preliminary examination intends to focus on analytical abilities and understanding rather than the ability to memorize. The new pattern includes two papers of two hours duration and 200 marks each. Both papers
              have multiple choice objective type questions only. They are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Paper I tests the candidate's knowledge on current events, history of India and Indian national movement, Indian and world geography, Indian polity panchayti Raj system and governance, economic and social development, environmental
                  ecology, biodiversity, climate change and general science, Art and culture.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Paper II (also called CSAT or Civil Services Aptitude Test), tests the candidate's skills in comprehension, interpersonal skills, communication, logical reasoning, analytical ability, decision making, problemsolving, basic
                  numeracy, data interpretation, English language comprehension skills and mental ability.It is qualifying in nature and the marks obtained in this paper are not counted for merit. However, it is mandatory for the candidate to score a
                  minimum of 33 per cent in this paper to qualify the Prelims exam.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h6>Mains</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h6><u>Examination</u></h6>
                <p>The Civil Services Main written examination consists of nine papers, two qualifying and seven ranking in nature. The range of questions may vary from just one mark to sixty marks, twenty words to 600 words answers. Each paper is of
                  a duration of 3 hours. Candidates who pass qualifying papers are ranked according to marks and a selected number of candidates are called for interview or a personality test at the Commission's discretion. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><u>Interview</u></h6>
                <p>Officially called the "Personality Test", the objective of the interview is to assess the personal suitability of the candidate for a career in public service by a board of competent and unbiased observers. The test is intended to
                  evaluate the mental calibre of a candidate. In broad terms, this is really an assessment of not only a candidate's intellectual qualities, but also social traits and interest in current affairs. Some of the qualities to be judged
                  are mental alertness, critical powers of assimilation, clear and logical exposition, balance of judgement, variety and depth of interest, ability for social cohesion and leadership, and intellectual and moral integrity.

                  The technique of the interview is not that of a strict cross-examination, but of a natural, though directed and purposeful conversation that is intended to reveal the mental qualities of the candidate. </p>
                <p>The interview is not intended to be a test either of the specialised or general knowledge of the candidate, which has been already tested through written papers. Candidates are expected to have taken an intelligent interest not
                  only in their special subjects of academic study, but also in the events which are happening around them both within and outside their own state or country as well as in modern currents of thought and in new discoveries which should
                  rouse the curiosity of all well-educated youth. The interview standards are very high and require thorough preparation as well as commitment. </p>

        <h4>Engineering Service Examination</h4>
        <p>The Indian Engineering Services (IES) are the services which cater to the technical and managerial functions of the government of India in the field of engineering. As in most countries, the Indian government recruits its civil servants
          and officials through competitive examinations. Many candidates take the exams, competing for a limited number of posts. IES officers are selected by the union government on the recommendation of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).
          A three-stage competitive examination (preliminary, main and personality tests), the Engineering Services Examination (ESE), is conducted by the UPSC for recruitment to the Indian Engineering Services.</p>
